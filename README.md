# CloudResume
Playing around with vscode at the moment, currently abit confused about these basic git commands such as git push, what different branches are, how to push code from vscode directly into e.a staging enviroment etc.


# Learning of the day
Git push is used after the staging is done, after only "git push" is used within terminal, the actual code is uploaded to github. Git push will not work after Branch "master" is commited. I need to investigate commiting code and pushing code.
